<div class="efeito_texto">
<h2>Synopsis</h2><p>Matteo was a peasant who studied medicine with his father, who lived near Tivoli,
    with his family (father, mother and brothers). His father was a veteran doctor who was working in Rome,
    helping those suffering from the Black Death. After returning, he shows symptoms of the disease. Feeling
    his life slipping away, his worried son tries in every possible way to reverse his condition. However,
    his efforts are in vain and as one of his father's last breaths, since Matteo is very dedicated to medicine,
    he asks for a letter to be deliveredto a friend who lived in Rome. So Matteo then goes on a mission not
    knowing what to expect.</p>
